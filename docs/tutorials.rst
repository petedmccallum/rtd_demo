**DEMO TEXT BORROWED FROM https://github.com/ralsina/rst-cheatsheet/blob/master/rst-cheatsheet.rst**

Titles are underlined (or over- and underlined) with
a nonalphanumeric character at least as long as the
text.

A lone top-level section is lifted up to be the
document's title.

Any non-alphanumeric character can be used, but
Python convention is:

* ``#`` with overline, for parts
* ``*`` with overline, for chapters
* ``=``, for sections
* ``-``, for subsections
* ``^``, for subsubsections
* ``"``, for paragraphs
